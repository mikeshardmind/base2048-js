# base2048

A base2048 implementation compatible with the [rust](https://github.com/LLFourn/rust-base2048) and [python](https://github.com/ionite34/base2048/) ones

The [prior art in js](https://github.com/qntm/base2048) Uses a different character map.

Note: This is currently a 1:1 rewrite of a pure python implementation available [here](https://github.com/mikeshardmind/wakfu-utils/blob/main/wakautosolver/b2048/encoder.py)

It's probably good enough as-is, but could likely be improved on.
